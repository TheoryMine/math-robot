Critical Path for IsaCoSy: 

 * Total term order for commutativity constraints. 
 *

theory data-structure for data

in progress: 

theory data-structure for functions



TODO: 

- Write nice name generation for constants/types/free-vars. Eiether a conversion table + function to convert term (or a nice-namer?)
- Paypal link via website. 
- Update website text: It usually takes XXX time for the robots to discover a new theorem. 
- generation of certificate from IsaPlanner proof/synthesis information.
- generate LHS of equation, no symmetries. re-use datatype generation. 
- generate RHS for a given LHS, no symmetries. by IsaCoSy.
- Isabelle datatype => internal datatype translation (polymorphism!)
- theory data-structure for theorems
- website email sending. 


IsaCoSy: 
- Change free-var limits not to depend on order of instantiation.   
- fix generation of sterm upto given term (currently a problem with free-vars). 
- allow inclusion of a given set of terms instead of just given constants (to make recursive calls measure decreasing).
- fix ordering: need total one for commutativity/change constraints after each theorem rather than each size. 
- Provide better mechanism to update constraints: shouldn't have to fully specify them beforehand; should be able to update an sterm from a given update to constinfo (e.g. by reconstruction of constraints).
- figure out how big to go: max size for IsaCoSy.
